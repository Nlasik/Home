            <h2>The valley of the Thames</h2>
            <pre>
              <strong>The metropolis grew and spilled over a more or less symmetrical valley site defined
                  by shallowgraveland clay ridges rising to about 450 feet (140 metres)
                  on the north at Hampstead and about 380 feet (115 metres) at Upper
                  Norwood 11 miles (18 km) to the south.Between these broken heights
                  to the north and south, the ground falls away in a series of graded
                  plateaus formed by gravel terraces—some at 100–150 feet (30–45 metres;
                  the Boyn terraces, such as Islington, Putney, and Richmond) and a second
                  and more extensive level, the Taplow terraces,at 50–100 feet (15–30 metres),
                  on which sit the City of London, the West End, the East End, and
                  the elevated southern districts such as Peckham, Battersea, and Clapham.
                  The lowest ground, just a few feet above high-tide level, is the extensive
                  floodplain of the valley floor.</strong>

            <h3>Panorama of the city</h3>
                         <pre>
                         <code>
            <samp>The natural lay of the land can be appreciated from several public vantage points.
                             Hampstead Heath offers the finest panorama over the central basin
                             of the metropolis. But from Shooters Hill, Upper Norwood, or Alexandra
                             Palace one has a choice of views: inward to the crowded skyline of the
                             City and West End or out to the open expanses of the Home Counties, the
                             Thames estuary, the South Downs, and the Weald. Such panoramas show that
                             London, for all its immensity, resembles more closely the limited metropolises
                             of the early 20th century than the amorphous and sprawling megalopolises of today,
                             such as Tokyo or Los Angeles. The line of the post-World War II Green Belt runs quite
                             comfortably along the encircling hills of the London Basin—the long ridge of the downs
                             to the south of London and, to the north, the more broken chain of heights running from
                             Iver Heath (above Heathrow Airport) clockwise through Ruislip Common, Bushey Heath,
                             Enfield Chase, Epping Forest, Hainault Forest, and South Weald.</samp>

            <h2 id="bc">Climate of London </h2>
            <p>Continuous records of London’s weather extend back to 1659, with specific data
                for wind direction available since 1723 and for precipitation since 1697.
                The fluctuations show a cyclic pattern, with troughs of hard winters and
                cold springs during the 1740s, 1770s, 1809–17, 1836–45, and 1875–82 followed
                by a long upswing after 1919, in which London’s climate became warmer, largely
                because of milder weather in the autumn months..</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Modern London has the equable climate of South East England, with mild winters
                  and temperate summers. The average daytime air temperature is 52 °F (11 °C),
                  with 42 °F (5.5 °C) in January and 65 °F (18 °C) in July. Statistics show that
                  the sun shines, however briefly, on five days out of six. Londoners shed their
                  winter overcoats in April or May and begin to dress warmly again in late October
                  The prevailing wind is west-southwest. Because of the sheltering effect of the
                  Chiltern Hills and North Downs, the city has slightly less rainfall than the Home
                  Counties. In an average year one can expect 200 dry days out of 365 and a precipitation
                  total of about 23 inches (585 mm) evenly distributed across the 12 months.</p>
